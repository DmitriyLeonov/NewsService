# NewsService
News service is a platform that provides last 24-hours news according to user’s preferences. Users can register at the platform, search news with keywords or just open recommendations and read the news that propose our service.<br>
<h3>Structure:</h3>
 <ul><li><h4>Pages</h4>
  <ul><li><h5>Homepage.</h5> Page with recommended or “hot” news and the ability to search news using keywords. It also contains user’s statistics at the right column
  <li><h5>Page with article.</h5> Articles, links to related articles and estimation ability will be placed here. Users can estimate the article if it fits them or not.
  <li><h5>Authorization page</h4>
  </ul>
  <li><h4>Databases</h4>
    We will have at least 2 databases: User’s database with their information for authentication and their preferences (keywords for our recommendation system) and article database that updates every day.
 <li><h4>Algorithms</h4>
     We are going to use content-based filtering algorithm. This User-based algorithm counts indexes according to users preferences, gives all users coordinates and according to these coordinates proposes articles for each user.
 <li><h4>API</h4>
     News API is the best case for this project, because requests already contain keywords and it has a huge spectrum of usage.
